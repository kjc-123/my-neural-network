# Neural Network Implementation
Neural network with one hidden layer training on MNIST

Done out of my personal curiosity

Special thanks goes to 3blue1brown for his series on Neural Networks, which is how I initially learned everything, and Michael Nielsen, whose neural network implementation I referenced.
